# PBCAwareClustering
A periodic-boundary-aware framework for identifying Fe-rich, Fe-poor, and boundary regions in atomic configurations using Gaussian-smeared density estimation, KMeans clustering, and topologically consistent 3D component labeling. Outputs include per-region composition and plots across multiple LAMMPS snapshots.
